# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-CodeClause-Internship
In this repository, we utilize the power of PyTorch to train a neural network capable of recognizing and classifying handwritten digits. This project was undertaken as part of an internship at CodeClause, where we delved into the exciting realm of deep learning and computer vision.
